        <p>1. You can access almost everything via the Javascript API provided by Phonegap. There are some limitations, for example, to doing anything "in the background". The media API does not implement the signals needed to implement playing while in another application, or for being controlled from the lock/task switching screens. (You have to extend the API with some Objective-C. It isn't hard, it's just tricky.)</p>

        <p>2. I'll probably try to implement Geolocation and the Compass (network too). I plan on totally throwing away my previous CRUD project and starting with a fresh concept.</p>

        <p>3. I've learned a lot of lessons over my many years of messing with these programming concepts. If possible, write tests. Correction, just plain write tests. There are lots of testing frameworks out there, just pick one and start using it. There are many forms of testing (TDD, BDD, etc.) just pick one and do it. I intend to have full unit tests for my upcoming CRUD app.</p>

        <p>4. As of right now, I think I'll make a basic shopping list app so that my wife and I can build a shopping list as we think of things. Maybe use the geolocation to find the nearest store (great for doing things on the way home) and alerts to remind you to get things or that an item was already purchased.</p>

        <p>5. I think I pretty much covered this in the previous question.</p>
